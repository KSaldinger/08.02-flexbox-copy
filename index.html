            <header>Yo!  Hi!  Hola!  Hello, I'm Katy.</header>
            <main>I'm a Responsive Designer & Developer who thrives on visually storytelling. When I'm not working,
                pursuing side projects or getting lost in the rabbit hole of blogs, I can be found hiking or just lost
                in the forest somewhere with my kids.
            </main>
            <div id="div-1" class="flex-items">
                I was born in New Jersey, raised in Texas and have roamed since I was a teen. My parents always told me 
                that I had "the grass is greener syndrome," well, turns out they were right. I always needed to move to
                greener pastures and no matter the reason, the answer was always "just move."
            </div>
            <div id="div-2" class="flex-items">
                My passions: Music and Mountains! Not necessarily in that order. I only like my music LOUD
                and I prefer my mountains very close. If I'm not enjoying one then there's no doubt I am 
                enjoying the other. Somebody needs to pass down the love of the planet and loud art to the next 
                generation (aka,my kids)!
            </div>
            <div id="div-3" class="flex-items">
                A fun fact: I just learned that a watermelon is a vegetable since it is part of the gourd family. Who knew?
                Well, probably a lot of people but hey, that just proves you can really learn something
                new every day which is a great thing.  We all know that knowledge is power (OK, enough with
                the proverbs already).
